## Synopsis

The Microchip AMI is designed for use with the Microchip Wi-Fi Client Module
(WCM) Development Kit (Microchip part number: DM182020). This development tool
is designed to commission to a local Wi-Fi network and communicate to the Amazon
AMI instance. This enables the user to quickly connect an embedded Microchip MCU
to a cloud server. This process offers the user the ability to learn how to
commission embedded products to local Wi-Fi networks, setup an Amazon AMI, and
create databases on the AMI instance.
